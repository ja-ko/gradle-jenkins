= jenkins gradle plugin


Imagine a gradle multiproject with lots of projects and several static code analyzer plugins. Now try building
these projects on a Jenkins CI. Usually you'll want a job per project to have finer control over your quality gates for
example. After all, you created those subprojects for a reason. Maintaining all that jenkins jobs by hand would be a
nightmare. The JobDsl Syntax provided by Jenkins partially solves these problems, but has in turn it's own set of
problems. Maintaining the jobdsl to stay in sync with your gradle multiproject can for example be cumbersome.

== How to use
This project provides two plugins:

* `eu.jkol.jenkins.job` configures how to build the project this plugin is applied to
* `eu.jkol.jenkins.jobdsl` generates the jobdsl for every build configured by the former
